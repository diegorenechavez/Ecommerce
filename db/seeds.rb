review_1 = Review.create(title: "Best Body Wash Out There!", rating: 5, author_id:1, product_id:4, body:"OK, I will start by admitting the texture of this body wash takes some getting used to - it is reminiscent of boogers or slime. Once you get over this fact, this body wash is pretty amazing, and one of my absolute favorites. I always use exfoliating gloves, loofah, or wash cloth to apply because it helps make suds. The scent is my favorite - banana! It lingers a bit throughout the morning, and moreso when I use my favorite body lotion with it - Sympathy for the Skin, which is like vanilla with a teensy tiny hint of banana. My skin feels so soft! Seriously, just try it. Once you get over the texture, it is wonderful.")
